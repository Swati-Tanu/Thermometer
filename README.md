# Thermometer

### A short and simple DOM application to understand the basics of correlation between HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

A simple DOM application using setTimeout & setInterval functionality. It is made using HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript. The main focus is on understanding how these three work together. An ample amount of comments are used throughout the code.
